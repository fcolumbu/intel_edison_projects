This program implements a simple cloud reporting thermostat that sends real data from a
Grove temperature module and displays the reading on a Grove LCD display, as well as,
sending it to the Intel IoT Analytics Dashboard.
The temperature setting is done using the Grove Rotary Potentiometer.
A Grove Relay is used to activate a device that can heat or cool.
